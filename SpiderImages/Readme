# README: SpiderImages

This folder contains more counterfactual examples extracted with MUCH from the FIFA_2023 dataset.

The dataset proposes a classification into 4 different classes based on 50 attributes of soccer players:

MF: MidFielder (red)
DE: DEfensor (blue)
FO: FOrward (green)
GK: Goal Keeper (yellow)

For each target class we divided the input feature into four main classes:

-) Mental Attributes
-) Physical Attributes
-) Techincal Skills
-) Foundamental Attributes

and for each of them we extracted counterfactuals, obtaining 16 different counterfactual explanations. In each image there is a spiderplot containing 
a dotted line representing the fact and the respective counterfactuals, which can be identified with the colors listed above.

There are in total 32 images (.eps and .png).

File "FIFA_SpiderPlots.pdf" contains all the spiderplots together.
